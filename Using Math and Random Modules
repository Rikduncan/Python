Using Math and Random Modules

#Math has tons of operations and we can't list them all out here like mentioned during the lecture

import math

num = int(input("Please enter your favorite number, and  we will tell you the square root: "))
print(math.sqrt(num))


#Random

import random

print("Print a random integer between 0 and 500:", random.randint(0, 500))
